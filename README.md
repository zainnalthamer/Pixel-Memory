## About the Project

I was tasked to build a grid-based game for project 1 of the Software Engineering course at General Assembly. Pixel Memory is a tile-based memory game where players must remember and select the correct tiles as levels progress. The game tests memory, accuracy, and speed with an increasing level of difficulty.

I used **HTML** to structure the game, **CSS** to style it and make it responsive, and **JavaScript** to implement the game logic, animations, and interactivity.

## Deployed Game Link
You can play the game [here](https://zainnalthamer.github.io/Pixel-Memory/). I hope you enjoy it!

## How to Play

- A few tiles will be briefly **highlighted**, memorize their positions.
- Once the highlight disappears, **click the same tiles** to proceed.
- Be careful! Clicking a wrong tile ends the game.
- Reach **Level 7** before time runs out to win.

## Features

- 6 levels of increasing difficulty.
- 45-second timer to challenge your speed.
- Visual feedback for game over/win conditions.
- Sound effects for level win and game over.
- Instructions popup.
